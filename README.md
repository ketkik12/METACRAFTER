# Beginner EVM Course_Submission
All about the course first â†“


 This course was designed to introduce about Web3 and get started with solidity programming.In the end, I was given a challenge to showcase my knowledge!

## Initiating
I wrote the code using the Solidity programming language, and I used Metacrafters ETH Proof as my primary source of learning.

## Explaination About The Challenge 
 I had a challenge to make a contract on the basis to mint and burn the token ., where I make a there variable : two strings and one uint 
1. Strings as tokenname 
2. Strings as tokenabbr (Abbreviation) 
3. uint as a totalsupply (Which I initially set as to be zero)


### Setup

* Here I used the Online Remix IDE for writing the solidity code.
* Then I created a file in this repository named contract_token.sol for publishing that same code on GitHub.

### Program Execution

* If you are using Remix IDE, you can simply compile the code with the help of compile option present at a side menu.
* After compiling, you have to deploy the Contract from the side bar itself. And after deploying you have to enter some inputs which is require to the smart contract.

## Experience 

I recommend the Metacrafters academy courses for upskill your knowledge. Also they have a strong community who available in your learning pathway.
